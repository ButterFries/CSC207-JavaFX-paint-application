	Yesterday :
	Today     : Started user story 5
	Obstacles : Trying to figure out how to implement the colour selector

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday : Started user story 5, and looked at how each class interacts with each other. Also checked how button events are handled in the classes. Took a look at user story 6. Finished user stories 6 and 7.
	Today     : Completed user story 5 and pushed it to master. The user can now selected from 5 different colours from the toolbar.
	Obstacles : Each object would change colours when the user were to pick a new colour since I accidently made the display colour be the colour currently selected, and not the one associated with the object

	Today     : Started looking at how css functions with javafx, and found how loading a .css file works
	Obstacles : The .css file couldn't be found at first, since the string couldn't be converted to the file's address

	Yesterday : Took a look at how css functions with javafx.
	Today     : Started implementing the css into the assignment

Nov 12, 2018
	Yesterday : Started implementing css into the assignment
	Today     : Finished the default theme and started on the dark theme.

Nov 13, 2018
	Yesterday : Finished the default theme and started the dark theme.
	Today     : Finished the dark theme and warm theme.

Nov 14, 2018
	Yesterday : Finished the dark and warm themes
	Today     : Tried different ways to implement rgba values into the dropdown bar menu.
	Obstacles : Trying to hook up the menu buttons to an eventhandler

Nov 15, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Implemented textFields for rgba values, fixed a bug where the polyline will not save if a new tool is clicked, 
		    and fixed a bug with tempObjects staying after the object has been created, until a new tempObject is created
	Obstacles : Getting an eventhandler for textFields, so the colour updates as the user types, instead of needing to press enter.
