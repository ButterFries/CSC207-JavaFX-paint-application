	Yesterday :
	Today     : Started user story 5
	Obstacles : Trying to figure out how to implement the colour selector

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday : Started user story 5, and looked at how each class interacts with each other. Also checked how button events are handled in the classes. Took a look at user story 6. Finished user stories 6 and 7.
	Today     : Completed user story 5 and pushed it to master. The user can now selected from 5 different colours from the toolbar.
	Obstacles : Each object would change colours when the user were to pick a new colour since I accidently made the display colour be the colour currently selected, and not the one associated with the object
