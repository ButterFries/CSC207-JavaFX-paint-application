				shape chooser panel, 
	Obstacles :in paint panel will need to change whenever fill or thickness is changed will

	Yesterday :Finished bug3 but also realized that when you change thickness or fill you 
	have to reselect the 'mode' so circle or rectangle and then the changes are applied.

	you don't have to reselect the mode.
